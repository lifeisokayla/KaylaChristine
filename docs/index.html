        <p><i>“When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. <br />
            When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. <br />
            They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life.”</i> -<em>John Lennon</em></p>
