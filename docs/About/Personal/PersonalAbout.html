            <h3 id="general">General Overview of my weird alien tendencies</h3>
            <p>23 year old college student. <br />
                I am literally <em>always</em> down to go to Taco Bell. Always. Will never say no. <br />
                I have a weird eye thing where my eyes shake back and forth if I concentrate on something. <br />
                It makes people think I'm an alien. Probably true but can neither confirm nor deny these accusations. <br />
                I'm also left handed. <br />
                I read a lot of conspiracy theories. Not healthy, but neither are my eating habits. <br />
                I have a rottweiler named Tasha and she's the <i>actual</i> cutest. :') <br />
                Obligated to say I'm vegan. <br />

            </p>

            <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
            <p>I am a second year student at <em>Gateway Community College</em> in New Haven, Ct.</p>
            <p>I am studying Engineering, and hope to continue my education to receive a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, 
                and one day land a career in software engineering/development.</p>
            <p>While all my computer friends crave for a career in front end developement,
                I aspire to work on operating systems and the computer architecture.
            </p>
            <p>My extracurriculars are simple, yet challenging: <br />
            I started a Mental Health Advcoacy Club after seeing a gap in student knowledge
        regarding mental health support and resources. <br />
            This has fortunately lead me to being the Charter President, which I am immensely proud of!~~ </p>

            <h3 id="mha">Mental Health Advocate</h3>
            <blockquote>
                Mental Health Advocacy for not only others but myself has been the greatest adventure.
                Without taking care of myself first, I would have never been able to lead the life I do today,
                and to truly advocate for others to do the same.
            </blockquote>

                    Create and orchestrate tabling sessions on the bridge
