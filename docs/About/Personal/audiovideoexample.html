        <h1>Once upon a time I did band: this is me doing the thing:::::::</h1>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nz2o4EiWDz4" frameborder="0" 
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>Also here's an audio clip:</p>
        <audio autoplay controls>
                <source src="/videos/Sergey_Cheremisinov_-_04_-_Northern_Lullaby.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>
            </audio>


        <h3>Video vs. Audio: the differences</h3>    
        <p>
            The most noticeable difference between audio and videos is that videos come with picture and sound, whereas
            audio is just the sound. Another key difference between the two, specifically in my examples, is the storage.
            The Youtube video of my former marching band is stored via Youtube's cloud services. The audio file is stored locally
            on my computer, and for GitHub purposes, is stored locally on my GitHub repository. The differences in the tags used
            is that the video utilizies the iframe tag, and audio uses the audio tag. While both utilize src, video uses more complex
            features such as width and height, frameborder, allowfullscreen and allow= is set to what is included in the video controls.
            This provides a user friendly experience that makes it easy for the coder to choose how much space in the site to use for 
            the video, and then for the client it's great because they have multiple options to choose from! We haven't learned about
            tinkering with the interface of the audio bar, which would be a more customizable experience and add what I would consider
            a better look and aesthetic. For now, our audio bar is pretty simple and cut to the chase. We only use the source src tag
            and inside that we only really specify what type of file it is, in this case audio/mpeg. :)
